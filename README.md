# flutter-firebase-boilerplate

A very basic voting App written with Flutter framework and which integrates with Firebase backend.
Can be used for every App project requiring a backend.

Based on tutorial from https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-firebase/

NOTE: the code source doesn't contain the android-manifest file, because this file
was tied to my specific database. In order to get one, you need to create a Firebase project, and
add connect a new Android app to it (as explained in the tutorial above).
